                    I'm not actively looking for work right now, so you won't find any case 
                    studies or password-protected, NDA-busting Figma projects here.</p>

                    But it's been a couple of decades since I last published any kind of 
                    online summary of my work, so this seems like a good time to put 
                    something together, even if it's really just a slightly wordier CV.

                    Let's go back to the beginning, shall we?
                </p>
                <h2>The 2000s</h2>
                <p>
                    Like many who started in the early days of web design, I'm entirely 
                    self-taught. Starting with books like "Teach Yourself HTML in 24 Hours" 
                    and "JavaScript for Beginners," I was there for the birth of web 
                    standards, later learning from seminal works like Jeffrey Zeldman's 
                    "Designing with Web Standards" and Jeremy Keith's "DOM Scripting." 
                    Starting out with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I later added server-side 
                    technologies like ASP and PHP to my arsenal, and for seven years ran 
                    a one-person design and development agency, working with both local and 
                    international businesses as well as a handful of big UK brands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A large part of the web standards movement was community-based, and I 
                    played a part in several community activities during that time. As 
                    Managing Editor and later Editor-in-Chief for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090427065215/http://www.digital-web.com/" title="Visit the homepage of Digital Web Magazine on archive.org after the final ever post" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Web Magazine</a>, I 
                    helped to promote many of the biggest names in the growing industry, 
                    interviewing or reviewing many designers and authors that are still a 
                    significant part of the web design world today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within the web standards blog community, I was also involved in the 
                    annual <a href="http://www.cssreboot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="The broken yet still live CSS Reboot website seems to have been neglected for many years now">CSS Reboot</a> event, when designers would unveil new, 
                    standards-based redesigns of their personal websites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also set up and ran the local chapter of the Refresh community movement in 
                    Cambridge, UK, which rapidly grew to become the largest web community in the city. 
                    Over several years we hosted regular events at local venues, welcoming 
                    speakers from around the country to deliver a varied roster of topics 
                    (including a couple of talks from myself).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alongside all of this activity, of course, I also had a day job. In 2001 I 
                    landed my first real web design job, working for a small agency in 
                    Peterborough that sadly folded, then I worked as a project manager and 
                    senior designer for a local building society, where I oversaw their 
                    internet banking service and new website launch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, in 2006, I joined a company right at the beginning of an incredibly 
                    successful journey into the world of online experimentation: Booking.com.
                </p>
                <h2>The 2010s</h2>
                <p>
                    Based in Amsterdam, Booking.com became a global leader in travel through 
                    extensive A/B testing and experimentation. I spent the decade working across 
                    multiple teams on the customer-facing website, focusing on usability, 
                    performance, and experimentation. As the team lead for the first ever 
                    usability team, I helped introduce user research into our process; I also contributed 
                    extensively to our user tracking setup, modernised our JavaScript maps 
                    library, and personally built the first iteration of our mobile website (at 
                    a time when nobody was sure mobile internet was going to become as ubiquitous 
                    as it is now).
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this period of hyper-growth I was also heavily involved in hiring — 
                    interviewing designers and developers and shaping the onboarding experience.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>“I built Booking.com’s first mobile site — back when nobody was sure mobile internet was going to matter.”</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    In 2012, I built a new UX team to redesign the partner extranet — a platform 
                    that had never before benefited from design input. We rebuilt it from the 
                    ground up with a focus on usability and clarity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accessibility has always been a personal priority too. At Booking I joined a 
                    company-wide taskforce to audit and improve accessibility issues, proving the 
                    business value through A/B testing and presenting our work at the annual 
                    company conference.
                </p>
                <h2>The 2020s</h2>
                <p>
                    Since the start of this decade my focus has been on two areas — customer 
                    service and engineering — and a series of 0-to-1 (ground-up) product 
                    development projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As part of the customer service UX team, I worked on both the platform used by 
                    our agents, and the surrounding ecosystem of services that enable our CS team;
                    my team created several new web services to streamline and manage our response 
                    templates. I was also the sole designer working on disaster recovery initiatives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And most recently, I’ve been leading UX and design for a new internal platform 
                    supporting thousands of engineers worldwide. I oversee everything from UI design 
                    to research and copywriting, with a UX roadmap that extends to 2028 — a project 
                    that should comfortably take me into the next decade.
